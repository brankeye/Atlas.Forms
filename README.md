## Special Thanks
Special thanks to Prism, headed by Brian Lagunas, without it this project wouldn't have been possible. I learned a lot from the Prism source code, which I am grateful for.

And a quick thanks to Xamarin.Forms.Toolkit, created by James Montemagno, for providing a simpler MessagingService implementation I was able to put to good use.
