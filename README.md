## Special thanks to Prism
Prism is a framework for building loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable XAML applications in Xamarin Forms.

If it were not for Prism (headed by Brian Lagunas), this project would not have been possible. I learned a lot from the Prism source code, which I
am grateful for. Thanks again!
